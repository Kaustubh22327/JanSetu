# Janhit 🌐  
**Empowering Citizens, Transforming Himachal**

Janhit is a civic engagement platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and local government authorities. It enables people to report local issues (like potholes, water shortages, and power cuts), vote on the urgency of problems, and track their resolution in real-time — all with the goal of making governance transparent, responsive, and citizen-driven.

## 🎯 Introduction

Citizens in India often face everyday issues such as:

It empowers citizens and supports smarter governance in Himachal Pradesh.
